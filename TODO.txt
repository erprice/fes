TODO

continue fleshing out the test framework
add LUA scripting to make related redis calls atomic
implement redis retries
convert hbase interface to thrift instead of REST
implement hbase retries
create a properties file
support more compact storage formats than strings...protobufs?
add support for batch adds
support arbitrary number of hbase index buckets, add this value to the properties file
lock events while manipulating them
bug: deleting one event will wipe out the hbase index for all events of the same expiration (and salt prefix)
bug: rest_view.py executes twice, starting twice as many daemons as needed
